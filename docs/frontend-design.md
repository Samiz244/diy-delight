# 🎨 Frontend Design

## Goal

Design the React frontend structure before implementation.

The frontend should support a guided pizza-building experience while keeping state, components, utilities, and API calls clearly separated.

---

# React Routes

```text
/             → Pizza Builder
/pizzas       → Pizza Collection
/pizzas/:id   → Pizza Detail
```

---

# Frontend Folder Structure

```text
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── PizzaBuilderPage.jsx
│   ├── PizzaCollectionPage.jsx
│   └── PizzaDetailPage.jsx
│
├── components/
│   ├── PizzaPreview.jsx
│   ├── ProgressTracker.jsx
│   ├── PriceDisplay.jsx
│   ├── StepSelector.jsx
│   ├── CookButton.jsx
│   ├── PizzaCard.jsx
│   └── EditDrawer.jsx

├── services/
│   └── PizzasAPI.js
│
└── utilities/
    ├── calculatePrice.js
    └── validatePizza.js
```

# State Ownership

`PizzaBuilderPage` owns the pizza-building state.

```js
{
  name: "",
  size: "",
  crust: "",
  sauce: "",
  cheese: "",
  topping: ""
}
```

Reason:

- Pizza preview needs the pizza state.
- Price display needs the pizza state.
- Progress tracker needs progress state.
- Step selector updates the pizza state.
- Cook button depends on completion state.

State should live in the closest common parent.

---

# Builder Page Components

```text
PizzaBuilderPage
│
├── PizzaPreview
├── ProgressTracker
├── PriceDisplay
├── StepSelector
└── CookButton
```

---

# PizzaPreview

Displays the pizza visually.

Reusable with variants:

```js
variant="large"
variant="small"
```

Used in:

- Builder page
- Collection cards
- Detail page

Visual changes:

- Size changes pizza scale.
- Crust changes border thickness.
- Sauce changes base color.
- Cheese changes cheese layer.
- Topping changes topping appearance.

---

# ProgressTracker

Displays pizza-building progress:

```text
🍕 ● ● ● ○ ○ ○
```

Tracks completed steps.

---

# PriceDisplay

Displays the calculated price.

Does **not** own pricing logic.

Receives price from the page.

---

# StepSelector

Displays the current step options.

Examples:

- Size
- Crust
- Sauce
- Cheese
- Topping

Unlocked previous steps remain editable.

---

# CookButton

Appears only after all steps are complete.

Starts the cooking animation and save flow.

---

# Collection Page Components

```text
PizzaCollectionPage
│
├── PizzaCard
│   └── PizzaPreview variant="small"
└── EditDrawer
```

---

# PizzaCard

Displays:

- Mini pizza preview
- Pizza name
- Pizza choices
- Current calculated price
- View button
- Edit button
- Delete button

---

# EditDrawer

Slides in from the right.

Uses temporary draft state.

Reason:

- Save commits changes.
- Cancel discards draft changes.
- Collection state remains stable until save.

Editable fields:

- Name
- Size
- Crust
- Sauce
- Cheese
- Topping

---

# Services

API calls live in:

```text
src/services/PizzasAPI.js
```

Functions:

```js
getPizzas()
getPizza(id)
createPizza(pizza)
updatePizza(id, pizza)
deletePizza(id)
```

Pages call service functions instead of using raw `fetch()` everywhere.

---

# Utilities

Utility files hold reusable business logic.

```text
utilities/
├── calculatePrice.js
└── validatePizza.js
```

## calculatePrice.js

Responsible for pricing rules.

Used by:

- Builder page
- Collection page
- Detail page

## validatePizza.js

Responsible for frontend validation rules.

Current invalid combo:

```text
Small + Stuffed Crust
```

Error:

```text
Stuffed crust is only available for Medium and Large pizzas.
```

---

# Frontend Principles

- Pages coordinate.
- Components display and collect input.
- Utilities contain reusable logic.
- Services communicate with the backend.
- Shared state lives in the closest common parent.
- Edit forms use draft state until saved.
- Reuse components instead of duplicating logic.
